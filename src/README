Directions for use:
Start application, log in. After successful login, you will be prompted with appointments within 15 minutes and then will proceed to the dashboard.
At the dashboard there will be multiple buttons to navigate the application. To add/edit a customers information, go to the customers page.
To add/edit a appointments information, go to the appointments page. On the main dashboard there are several reports about customer/appointments to be observed.
To close the application, navigate to the dashboard and at the top right there will be a log out button.

The additional report I chose was to observe appointments by title and day. With that report it would be easy to know what appointments are in the near future.
